# New in awesome_selfhosted
awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted is really great. But I want to see if there are new cool self hosted tools available.

This repository runs a Github action that scrapes the awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted repository daily and checks if there are some newcomers.

It then creates an issue, so when notifications are activated you get the news via email. Old issues are closed to avoid clutter.

Feel free to fork, run at your own timescale.

The action needs write permissions.
